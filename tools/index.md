# Introduction

The VEAF Mission Creation Tools provides scripts that make missions behave dynamically, and tools that are used to manipulate missions.

# *veaf-tools* application

This NodeJS application is a collection of tools that can be used to manipulate missions.

At the moment, it contains the following tools:
- Weather injector
- mission selector

See the [VEAF Tools application documentation page](veaf-tools.md) for more details.

## Weather injector

The Weather injector is a tool that transforms a single mission file into a collection of missions, with the same content but different weather and starting conditions.

It can be used to inject a predefined DCS weather definition, read a METAR and generate a mission with the corresponding weather, or even use real-world weather.

It can also create different starting times and dates for the mission, either with absolute values (e.g., 26/01/2023 at 2:20Â p.m.), or with predefined "moments" (e.g., two hours after sunset).

This is a very useful tool to use with a server that runs 24/7 and that needs to have different weather conditions every time it starts the same mission.

See the [VEAF Tools application documentation page](veaf-tools.md) for more details.

## Mission selector

The mission selector is used to start a dedicated server with a specific mission, depending on a schedule that is defined in a configuration file.

See the [VEAF Tools application documentation page](veaf-tools.md) for more details.

# LUA dictionary normalizer

TBD

Full documentation is available [here](lua_dictionary_normalizer.md).
